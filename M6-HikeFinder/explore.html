  <div class="about-content">
    <p><strong>How I stay committed to learning</strong></p>

    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
      simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>

    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey
      with the world.</p>

    <p><strong>How I got started</strong></p>

    <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After
      each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of
      what I learned using my own words.</p>

    <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
      others learn and stay motivated.</p>
